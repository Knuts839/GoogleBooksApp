## Description

This is a REST API service search tool that makes an API call to the GoogleBooks API each time you make a search and returns only book results related to that search term. It will not return movies, articles, and other forms of media. This results in a very targeted search. Technologies used: React, JavaScript, Materialize CSS framework, MVC file structure, and Mongoose.

This application connects the front end of REACT with a node express backend. This Google book app is a full-fledged MERN stack application. It combines the front-end component structure of REACT, connecting the pages with react router dom, linking it to a db (Mongo) and deploying it on Heroku and Mongo Atlas. It allows the user to search for a book using Google book api.  User does not even need to have an exact title.  They can input just a few key words and they will find their book. They can preview a book and save it to a db.  When saved, the book is placed on the bookshelf. They can also delete a book from their shelf. The api key is hidden. The api key has a very high number of daily calls.
