## Description

This is an application that connects the front end of react with a node express backend. This google book app is a full fledged MERN stack application. It combines the front end component structure of react connecting the pages with react router dom linking it to a db specifically Mongo and deploying it on Heroku and Mongo Atlas. It allows the user to search for a book using google book api does not even have to have an exact title just a few key words and they will find there book. They can preview a book save a a book to the db and then the book is placed on the bookshelf and they can also delete a from their shelf. The api key is hidden. The api key has a very high ammount of daily calls. Any thats about it for the application. It was challenging to put together but very rewarding when finished.
